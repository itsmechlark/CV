## Ruan Odendaal

### About me
After spending the majority of my career thinking about the 'what' and the 'why' when building consumer products, I felt like something was missing. I've always been drawn to the 'how', so I enrolled in Makers Academy and haven't looked back since.

Now I'm putting my curiosity and inquisitive nature to good use in the world of software engineering.

Looking for Full Stack development roles in an organisation where I can continue to learn and be challenged every day. Really excited and passionate about solving consumer problems.
